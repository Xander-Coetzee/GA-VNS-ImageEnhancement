# GA-VNS Image Enhancement

This project implements an image enhancement pipeline using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Variable Neighbourhood Search (VNS) to automatically enhance greyscale images.

## Project Structure

- `input/`: Contains the training and test images.
  - `training/`: Training images (distorted and ground truth).
  - `test/`: Test images (distorted and ground truth).
- `output/`: Contains the enhanced images generated by the GA and VNS pipelines.
  - `ga/`: Images enhanced by the GA.
  - `vns/`: Images enhanced by the VNS.
- `src/`: Contains the source code.
  - `main.py`: The main script to run the experiment.
  - `metaheuristics.py`: Implementation of the GA and VNS algorithms.
  - `image_processing.py`: Image enhancement functions.
  - `evaluation.py`: Evaluation metrics (MSE, PSNR, SSIM).
- `requirements.txt`: The required Python packages.

## Setup

1. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install the required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Experiment

To run the full experiment, execute the `main.py` script from the root directory:

```
python src/main.py
```

## Output

The script will:

1. Load the training and test images.
2. Run the Genetic Algorithm to find the best enhancement pipeline.
3. Apply the best GA pipeline to the test images and save them in `output/ga/`.
4. Print the evaluation metrics for the GA-enhanced images.
5. Run the Variable Neighbourhood Search to find the best enhancement pipeline.
6. Apply the best VNS pipeline to the test images and save them in `output/vns/`.
7. Print the evaluation metrics for the VNS-enhanced images.
8. Print a final comparison table of the GA and VNS results.
